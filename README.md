Project Euler on HackerRank
================

## Why this repo

The problems of project euler are all about mathematics. They are mostly hard to solve with little knowledge of math and programming.

It is originally hosted on https://projecteuler.net/. However, part of the problems have been migrated to Hacker Rank with great difficulty increasement.

## What're in this repo

Here are some codes of the problems [C++] I have resolved. I'm sorry that there are few/none comments in my codes. 

But if you are interested in the thoughts of them, you can visit my blog (https://blog.crazyark.me) (all in Chinese and maybe I will port some of my posts into English later). 

If you have any problems or thoughts, please contact me via email (arkbriar@gmail.com). I am so happy to talk with you guys.

Hope they are useful and cheers!üç∫
